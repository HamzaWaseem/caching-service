Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/hamzawaseem/caching-service.git
cd caching-service
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database (if applicable):

Ensure you have the necessary database configuration in place (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Run any database migrations or setups, as needed for your project.
Usage
Start the application: To run the FastAPI application:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Transform strings and cache results: You can use the exposed API endpoints to send requests for transforming strings and caching the results. Details of available endpoints will be listed in the auto-generated API docs.

Example of how to interact with the API:

POST request to /transform/ with a list of strings in the body to get transformed strings.
Running Tests
To run the tests using docker-compose:

Build the containers (if you haven't already):

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose build
Run the tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose run tests
This will run all the tests defined in the tests/ folder. Ensure your test coverage is complete for proper validation.
